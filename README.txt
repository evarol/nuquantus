INSTALLATION
============

1) Unzip Nuquantus_v1.zip

For Windows, Linux 64 bit users:
2) Mex files for Windows 64 bit, and Linux 64 are precompiled in Nuquantus/LIBLINEAR. The program is ready to use.

For Mac or other operating systems or 32 bit systems:
2) In MATLAB, go to directory Nuquantus/LIBLINEAR/mac/matlab/
3) Type "make" in command line and press enter. You may need to obtain necessary compilers for this step. See http://www.mathworks.com/support/compilers/ for more information.
